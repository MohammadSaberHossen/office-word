        <p>Hello! My name is Mohammad Saber Hossen. I am a Computer Science and Engineering student currently in my 3rd semester at Premier University Chattagram, with a GPA of 3.14/4 over the first two semesters. I am also a freelance web designer and developer, skilled in creating responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. <br>
        
        My relevant coursework includes Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, Database Management Systems, and Object-Oriented Programming. In my experience as a freelance web developer, I have designed and developed multiple websites for small businesses and personal clients, ensuring their requirements are met with tailored solutions. My technical skills extend to Python, C, and Java, and I am familiar with various web development tools and practices. <br>

        Beyond technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities, an eagerness to learn, and adaptability. I am excited about the possibilities in the field of front-end development and look forward to continuing my journey in this exciting domain.</p>
